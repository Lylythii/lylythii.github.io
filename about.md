# Introduction
Hi there. I'm Lylythii, & I like to work on ambitious projects.
Writing a competent about me is pretty difficult, so I'll just list some interesting things I do or strive to do.
It's a bit easier to be technically-minded & write this as more of a "resource" than as a biography.

## Where to people know me from?
While I can't be absolutely sure for you, & given I tend to "make my way around" places. I can be sure some people probably know me from YouTube, Discord, or perhaps Soundcloud if you're feeling extra curious.

Some time ago I uploaded the official soundtrack for '[Minecraft: Lily Pad (Alpha-ver 1.0.16)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWxjZ0nHFYNq7Iv7NiBvzQ)' to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3BvUG7U9__lkhbUqYUTR81bqkXsiKeD2), & [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lylythii/sets/minecraft-alpha-1016-lilypad-ost). & Prior to that the Minecraft [1.18](https://youtu.be/T8FZLbFQAuY) & [1.19](https://youtu.be/9gxhESR1--A) OST's to YouTube.
This increased my channel growth a lot. & many users still find their way back to it.
Maybe you like [TerraFirmaCraft](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/TerraFirmaCraft) & wanted to listen to the soundtrack in full. I also shared that [here](https://youtu.be/QTclcZFbGN4).

Prior to that I made some rather odd content I've since removed. & music I'm not really fond of any longer. Slowly replacing it with 'better' content.

Maybe you met me on Discord somewhere, & we shared a common interest, or you saw something I was doing & liked it enough to profile-creep. That's okay. [GitHub](https://github.com/Lylythii) is probably the right place to find it anyway.

A lot of people follow me on Twitter, I don't know why. That's Twitter for you.

## Streaming
I'm not very good at it, but I do stream when I get the chance. When I do it's on Twitch [@Lylythii](https://twitch.tv/Lylythii). I'm probably streaming Modded Minecraft, or at times some obscure shareware/freeware game from 3 decades ago. It varies at times, but it's generally Minecraft.

## YouTube & Content Creation
Currently my content is a bit all over the place, ranging from sharing music albums, to some tracks I made.
I'm hoping to improve that, share more original works, collaborate with others & upload gameplay, stream VOD's, & development updates for the projects I'm working on.
We'll see where that goes in the future.

## Minecraft & Modding
I dabble in modding at times, probably biting off more than I can handle, but we make-do.
Most of my modding stuff related to Minecraft ends up on [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/members/lylythii/projects).
I am working on a Minecraft total overhaul project in my spare time, originally based on the mod TerraFirmaCraft. It's a long way from being complete, but I do hope it'll be worth the wait.
That project is intended to have its own lore, original soundtrack, sound design & art style. A unique progression tree & gameplay concepts.
I'll keep you updated on that when I can, but a lot of what gets done in relation to it stays behind closed doors for now. & my free time is very limited currently, unfortunately.

If you've been around the TerraFirmaCraft community long enough, you've probably encounted a modpack called 'TerraFirmaCraft: Reloaded'.
I've always, somewhat, had involvements in that projects growth & community. & while it might not show like it used to then, we're still around.
I'm still trying to relight the fire that went out all those years ago.
In relation to that I'm currently porting TerraFirmaCraft: Reloaded to [TerraFirmaCraft+](https://cursforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcplus), & hope to maintain it on that version, with a public community server, for as long as reasonably possible.

## Theming & Modding
If you've known me for long enough you'll probably start to notice that I like to modify & alter everything I can get my hands on, make something new of it, or something personal or unique.
Some solid examples of this would be client-side theming of applications, some I've shared, some I haven't or won't for one reason or another.
You can find that stuff on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Lylythii).
